          highest standards of vehicle safety, customer protection, and responsible driving.
          Please take a few moments to read our safety and security guidelines before starting

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">1. Vehicle Safety Inspections</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Every ZentraCar vehicle is inspected before and after each rental. This includes
          checking brakes, tires, engine fluids, lights, and safety equipment to ensure
          optimal performance and road safety.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">2. Driver Requirements</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          All drivers must hold a valid driver’s license and meet the minimum age requirement.
          We recommend familiarizing yourself with local traffic laws and speed limits in
          the area you’ll be driving.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Emergency Assistance</h2>

          In the event of a breakdown, accident, or emergency, our 24/7 support team is ready
          to assist you. Emergency contact numbers are provided in the rental agreement and
          inside each vehicle.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">4. Security of Personal Belongings</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Please do not leave valuable items visible inside the vehicle when unattended. Lock
          all doors and keep windows closed to minimize the risk of theft.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">5. COVID-19 & Hygiene Practices</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          All vehicles are sanitized before each rental. We recommend carrying hand sanitizer,
          avoiding unnecessary contact with high-touch surfaces, and following local health
          guidelines during your trip.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">6. Reporting Unsafe Behavior</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          If you notice unsafe driving or vehicle issues during your rental, please report it
          immediately to our customer service team so we can take corrective action.
